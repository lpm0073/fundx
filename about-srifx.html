    <h4 style="color:#013878;">Rigorous performance criteria</h4>
    <p>The first screen uses FundX’s time-tested Upgrading strategy to own core diversified stock funds with strong recent returns. Funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well in the coming months or even years.</p>

     <h4 style="color: red !important;">Effective ESG integration</h4>
     <p>The second screen integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into FundX’s Upgrading approach. This non-financial performance indicator is applied as a risk measure in an effort to generate long-term competitive investment performance and positive societal impact.</p>

     <h4 style="color:#4E9D2D;">An Emphasis on Impact Investing</h4>
     <p>SRIFX seeks to reward funds that are impact investors. These funds actively engage with companies to help them more effectively use their resources, reign in excessive executive compensation, address climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns. Impact-oriented funds must meet our rigorous performance requirements to be included in the portfolio.</p>

    <h2>New Opportunities in Sustainable Investing</h2>
    <p>
      Sustainable investing has come a long way from what was previously called socially responsible investing. There are smart new strategies and tools that are uncovering many new investment opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people haven’t kept up with all the ways that sustainable investing has changed. They assume that sustainable issues will take a hit as government policies and regulations change; they don’t realize that today some of the biggest changes come from consumer demand and the market.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another persistent misconception about sustainable investing is that it only focuses on environmental factors. In fact, sustainable investing covers a wide range of important issues that are grouped into three broad categories: environmental, social and governance (ESG).
    </p>

    <h3>Understanding ESG</h3>
    <h4>E is for Environmental</h4>
    <p>
      Environmental issues are perhaps the most widely understood. They consider a company’s impact on the planet. A company with strong environmental practices uses renewable energy; reduces emissions; supports clean air and water; and works to address the risks of climate change.
    </p>

    <h4>S is for Social</h4>
    <p>
      Social issues are based on how a company affects people, including its employees and customers. A socially responsible company treats its workers fairly, provides a productive workplace, keeps customer data secure and creates good products that are safe to use.
    </p>

    <h4>G is for corporate governance</h4>
    <p>
      Governance is about how a company runs its business. A company with good governance works to balance the needs of executives and shareholders. It has a diverse and independent board of directors. It’s open about its political and lobbying efforts, and it has policies in place to prevent bribery or corruption.
    </p>

    <h3>Why ESG matters</h3>
    <p>
      A company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies help investors determine which companies they want to support, and many companies are finding that ESG practices can also be good for business. A company can save money by using renewable energy and it could gain customers by producing safe products. A company with strong oversight from its board may operate more efficiently or avoid costly lawsuits or fines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studies have repeatedly found that companies with good ESG policies also have performed well. A 2015 review<sup>1</sup> of more than 2,200 studies since the 1970s found a positive link between ESG factors and good financial performance.
    </p>

    <h3>How to find good ESG investments</h3>
    <p>
      Many funds seek to own companies with strong ESG practices, and new fund ESG ratings from Morningstar and MSCI have substantially expanded the number of funds to choose from. A 2016 MSCI study<sup>2</sup> found that thousands of funds had “significant exposure to sustainable impact themes”, but only 14% of these funds were self-professed ESG or sustainable funds.
    </p>

    <p>
      How you use ESG ratings, however, really matters. Funds with terrific ESG ratings aren’t always the best performers, so if you only use ESG scores to select funds, you may not get the returns you need to fund a comfortable life in retirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since ESG ratings are based on a fund’s portfolio and not on any one particular stock, you may find that some funds with high ESG ratings own companies that you don’t want to support, or these funds may not focus on the issues that are most important to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      ESG ratings also change as the funds’ portfolio changes, so you may need to check on your funds more often to make sure they’re still up to your standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      With our new Sustainable Impact Fund (SRIFX), we’ve incorporated ESG ratings into our time-tested Upgrading strategy. This way, we seek to own funds that have strong recent returns and good environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings. We monitor a fund’s performance and ratings regularly to keep you invested in a way that we believe has the potential to build wealth and build a better world.
    </p>

    <h3>Introducing FundX Sustainable Impact Fund (SRIFX)</h3>
    <p>
      The Sustainable Impact Fund is designed to help you build wealth and build a better world.
    </p>

    <h4>Invest in funds with strong recent returns</h4>
    <p>
      We manage SRIFX using our time-tested Upgrading approach. Upgrading leads us to invest in funds with strong recent returns because these funds may continue to do well. It’s designed to help investors build wealth, navigate changing markets and reach lifelong investment goals.
    </p>

    <h4>Own diversified stock funds with strong ESG ratings</h4>
    <p>
      SRIFX also seeks to own funds with robust ESG ratings. These ratings identify funds that are invested in companies with good environmental, social and governance practices. ESG investing seeks to help you make a difference in the world.
    </p>

    <h4>Professionally managed portfolio of sustainable funds</h4>
    <p>
      SRIFX is a fund-of-funds, which means you’ll own a portfolio of diversified stock funds that is built, monitored and managed by FundX’s experienced money managers.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Invest</h3>
    <p>
      You can invest in SRIFX at most major brokers, like Schwab or Fidelity, often for no transaction fee, or you can purchase the Fund directly from our shareholder services for as little as $1,000.

<strong>DISCLOSURE
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The FundX Upgrader Funds (“Funds) are considered “funds of funds” and an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks and its share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds. Shareholders will pay higher expenses than they would if they invested directly in the underlying funds. The Funds employ an “Upgrading” strategy whereby investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value. The Sustainable Impact Fund’s sustainable impact investment policy, which incorporates an analysis of environmental, social and corporate governance factors, may result in the Fund foregoing opportunities to buy certain Underlying Funds when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or selling its holdings in certain Underlying Funds for sustainable impact investment reasons when it might be otherwise disadvantageous for it to do so. The Funds invest in underlying funds and these underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involve greater volatility than investing in larger, more established companies, or they may invest in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods; these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The underlying funds may invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise; this risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. While the Upgrader Funds are diversified, the underlying funds may invest in a limited number of issuers and therefore may be considered nondiversified. The underlying funds may engage in short sales; an underlying fund’s investment performance may suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than intended. Some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense. Some underlying funds may use derivatives, which involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares. The underlying funds may invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments.</strong>
